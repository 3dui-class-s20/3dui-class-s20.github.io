# Schedule

The schedule will very likely change, but it represents the current best estimate of what topics will be covered and when.  The MIDTERM will happen the 7th week (Feb 18 or 20), and is initially scheduled for the 20th.  It may moved if need be. 

We will update it here and post announcements on canvas when things change.

Required readings are in bold.

Any reading in parenthesis are recommended, and you should at least skim them to be familiar with them at a high level (in case you need that material to understand future chapters, or for an assignment).
